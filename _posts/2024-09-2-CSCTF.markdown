# CSCTF
## Forensics
### Social Distencing

The challenges gave us a zip contains of 3 files, look like them got encrypted by windows defenders (the challenge name also a hint for this)

using this [script](https://gist.github.com/OALabs/30346d78a1fccf59d6bfafab42fbee5e) we can decrypt the file and get the flag

The challenge gave us 3 file, its a 3D cube with random texture you can use some online tool to solve this but I will write the intended way (the author show us in discord after the CTF ended btw)

### Bad Packets

We got a pcap file, open it the first thing that got in my eyes is the size of the HTTP stream, its enourmous.

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/CSC/bad_packets/image.png)

checking the content its just google search, but there some suspicious thing

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/CSC/bad_packets/image_2.png)

as you can see the GUID it contain a string that doesnt look like a normal GUID
```
GET /images?guid=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 HTTP/1.1
```
this should be a normal GUID, a GUID is typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string. So there something going on with these weird GUID string.
After some research I found this [post](https://nasbench.medium.com/understanding-detecting-c2-frameworks-trevorc2-2a9ce6f1f425), its called [TrevorC2](https://github.com/trustedsec/trevorc2), so using this [script](https://github.com/Abdelrahme/Trevorc2_decrypt/blob/main/trevorc2_decrypt.py) from [@Abdelrhman](https://github.com/Abdelrahme) **(I didn't solve this)**

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/CSC/bad_packets/image_3.png)

and you got the Flag
