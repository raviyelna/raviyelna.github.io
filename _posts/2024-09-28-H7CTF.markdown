# H7CTF
## Forensics
### Khalib

The challenge gave us a white image but look closely it not just only white, just zoom it and you will find the flag lying there

The challenge gave us a weird image, after checking it for awhile and read the description I still have no clue but my teammate got it

So here how it need to be done, the chall desp mentioned about Fourier, if you reasearch about his name there áº£e something called [**Fourier Transform in Cryptography**](https://medium.com/privacy-preserving-natural-language-processing/homomorphic-encryption-for-beginners-a-practical-guide-part-2-the-fourier-transform-77bcaf9a1756) and here the script to do that

```py
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load in greyscale
img = cv2.imread('flag.png', 0)

# fourier transform
f = np.fft.fft2(img)
fshift = np.fft.fftshift(f)

magnitude_spectrum = 20*np.log(np.abs(fshift))

plt.imshow(magnitude_spectrum, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Magnitude Spectrum')
plt.show()
```

Running that code will give you this

### GhostIP

the Challenge gave us a pcap file and told us to look for the attacker's IP.
its pretty obvious by checking the weight of these conversartion and the their behaviour we can easily confirm it 192.168.1.9, so I wont be talking much about this challenge.

### Captain Cool

At first when looking at the challenge I immediately try stegsnow but it return nothing after checking it plain colour I saw that there a b64 string at the bottom

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/H7CTF/challs/Forensics/CaptainCool/image.png)

this can be decoded to ```youspottingthismeansyougotsomesharpeyeswellkeeplooking```, anyway it just a distraction so put it away.

You can wandering around the internet and you will eventually find something call "openstego" running the image inside that as extract mode and you got a binary

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/H7CTF/challs/Forensics/CaptainCool/solve.png)

Decode that string will give us a hex string then from thet hex string you can get the flag

### Empty

The challenge gave us a zip file but it has a password, let crack it first

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/H7CTF/challs/Forensics/Empty/john.png)

okay so we got the password, unzip there a github repo inside the first thing I would be checking is commit section but unfortunately I wasnt be able to solve this because I was solving like 15 mins before the ending (I was studying lmao, Idek why this CTF opened right in the middle of the week instead of the weekend) anyway lets get back solving it, if you open the Head in the log you will see alot of weird string like this

![]({{site.url}}/Writeup_images/H7CTF/challs/Forensics/Empty/image.png)

Combine it with title of the challenge and some research (actually its chatGPT) I know that its [zero-width stego](https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html) 
pasting the whole commit msg and we got the flag

thanks for reading, eventhough the CTF occur right in the middle of the week but our team managed to achive a wonderful place, it 11th placed, GGWP guys
